To just see what portage will install you can use:
emerge <package> -pv
It will only display the packages

You can run emerge with --quiet flag, then it doesn't show all the compilation output

if some packages require changes in use flags or unmasking, and you don't want to do that maually you can use:
emerge --ask --autounmask --autounmask-write=y
It will create a remporary changes file, and you can apply it with:
dispatch-conf, and press U to use them

If you want to be up to date with the newest packages, run:
emerge --sync
once in a while, it refreshes available packages.

If some package is masked for your architecture, you can add it's name in:
/etc/portage/package/accept_keywords/<ANYFILE>

ps3-gentoo-installer --username <YOUR USERNAME> --password <YOUR PASSWORD> --device /dev/ps3dd
