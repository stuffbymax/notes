## describe what DNS server does

- translate requests for names into IP addresses

----

## Describe the factors that affect the perormace if cpu

- cores
- therds
- speed (HZ) 
- cashe
- logical processors

### core
 - a single processing unit within the CPU that can execute instructions (besicaly a cpu in cpu)

### therds
a sequence of instructions given to the CPU by a program or application

----

## describe the purpose of real-time-os

- the purpose of real time OS is to give the data/info in real time   

----

## describe 2 features of IDE

- debuging
- liberies preinstalled 

### one of IDE features is debugging 
it help the coder to find or fix errors by outputing and providing detailed feedback

### Liberies
- in IDEs Libaris are typicaly preinstalled this is good for efficency because coder doesnt need to install the libary that the code depens on

## identify 3 advantages of connecting devices to a network

- one of advatage to connectiong device to a network  

---

## describe the differences between a LAN and WAN

### LAN Local Area Network
- LAN is close range conectivity like in offces 
---

### WAN Wide Area Network
- WAN conection is across the globe

---

### Explain the purpose of router in network
---

- 1. Descripe the purpose of the session layer in the OSI seven-layer model
- 2. explain how packet switching works

### responsible for the organisation of the connection between two end systems

### sender sends a message it will be a split to packets then it go throw route and to recriver

- 1. explain the purpose of a hypervisor
- 2. identyfy two benefits of virtualisation

## purpose of hypervisor

 #### is that a Hybervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VM by sharing resources

### identyfy two benefits of virtualisation

1. one of the benefit of virtualizationb is to be able to create a multiple computers out of one

2. another benefit is that the setup is simplyfied without the need to install and initialise OS on physical machine

- also data security is improved since the last known settings are saved and can be recoverd in case of system crash

- also cost because you have multiple computers in one

## what is ment by the term hybrid cloud model

-  hybrid is when you combined interconnected public and private cloud infracture
 (using public cloud fasilities will reduce the cist of providing all services using the private cloud)

----

## describe what is ment by the term infrastructure as a service
- is a subscriber service that provides computer, network and storage resources on demand vua internet



## describe two advantages of data as a Service (DaaS)

- one of adavantages DaaS is that data can be accessed anyware, anyone,and any purpose

- another advantages is that the cloud uses group and individual access control ti share files (users can create, organise, and modify files)

###  what is DaaS?

-  DaaS is a cloud based software that provides tools for working with data

---

### what is ment by the term resilent
- withstand and recover from disruption

### what is ment by the term device hardening

-  device hardening is the proccess of making a device more resilent **(secure)** for example updating firmware

- descibe two benefits of the star network topology

2. 
- Explain what is ment by p2p netowrk
- identify two advantages of p2p network
- identify two disadvantages of p2p 
- describe one situation where p2p is good

3. 

- Describe the purpose of the ALU in CPU
- expain two factors that determine the perfmance of the CPU in computer

4. 
- explain what is ment by multi-tasking os
- describe one method of scheduling jobs in a multi-taskig OS

5. 

- describe the purpose of the session layer in the OSI seven-later model
