# Key Points to Cover

## What Happened?
- In January 2025, Facebook blocked posts containing links to [DistroWatch.com](https://distrowatch.com).
- Users who shared links to the site received warnings, and some had their accounts restricted.

## Why Did Facebook Flag DistroWatch?
- Facebook's cybersecurity filters flagged the website.
- **The reason?** DistroWatch linked to an external site that had been hacked.
- Facebook’s automated system likely blacklisted DistroWatch due to this indirect connection.

## Was DistroWatch Hacked?
- **No!** DistroWatch itself was not compromised.
- However, one of the websites it linked to was compromised, triggering Facebook’s security measures.

## Facebook's Response & Reversal
- DistroWatch’s editor, Jesse Smith, tried appealing but had his account locked.
- Facebook later admitted it was a **mistake** and lifted the ban.
- They clarified that **Linux-related content is not being censored**.

## Lessons from the Incident
- **Automated moderation isn’t perfect** – even trusted sites can get flagged.
- **False positives happen** when cybersecurity measures are overly aggressive.
- **Content creators and websites should monitor their outbound links** to avoid linking to compromised sites.

## Final Thoughts
- This case shows the **challenges of content moderation** on large platforms.
- While cybersecurity is important, **overblocking legitimate websites** can cause unnecessary issues.
- Fortunately, **DistroWatch is back on Facebook** – but this raises concerns about **how much control tech giants have over what we can share online**.
